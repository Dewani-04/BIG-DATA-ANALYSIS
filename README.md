TASK DESCRIPTION: Conclusion

This analysis used PySpark on Google Colab to efficiently process and analyze a real-world stock dataset.

Scalability Note:
PySpark handled the dataset in a distributed way, allowing processing of larger-than-memory files efficiently within Google Colab's limited RAM. This proves its capability in real-world big data scenarios.

Next Steps:
This analysis can be extended with predictive modeling (e.g., stock price forecasting using Spark MLlib).
